\description{
A dataset containing the reference profiles obtained from various
tumor infiltrating non-malignant cell types: \emph{B cells},
\emph{cancer-associated fibroblasts}, \emph{CD4 T cells}, \emph{CD8 T cells},
\emph{endothelial cells}, \emph{Macrophages} and \emph{NK cells}.

\details{
These were obtained from single-cell RNA-seq data from 9 donors from
the publication of \href{http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/189.full}{
\cite{Tirosh et al., 2016, Science}}. The samples
come from melanoma tumors (extracted from primary tumors and non-lymphoid
tissue metastases). The classification for each sample with
respect to each cell type is the one given by Tirosh et al., except for
the CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, that were identified from the T cells based
on the expression of CD4, CD8A and CD8B as described in
\href{https://elifesciences.org/articles/26476}{
 \cite{Racle et al., 2017, eLife}}.
