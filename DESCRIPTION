Description: Package implementing EPIC method to estimate the proportion of
    immune and cancer cells from bulk gene expression data. It is based on
    reference gene expression profiles for the main immune cell types and it
    predicts the proportion of these cells and of the remaining "other cells"
    that are the remaining cells (cancer, stromal, endothelial) for which no
    reference profile is given.
